## Why?

Some advantages of using TerminalGPT-Pro over the chatGPT browser-based app:

- It doesn't disconnect like the browser-based app, so you can leave it running in a terminal session on the side without losing context.
- It's highly available and can be used whenever you need it.
- It's faster with replies than the browser-based app.
- You can use TerminalGPT-Pro with your IDE terminal, which means you won't have to constantly switch between your browser and your IDE when you have questions.
- TerminalGPT-Pro's answers are tailored to your machine's operating system, distribution, and chip-set architecture
- Doesn't use your conversation data for training the model (unlike the browser-based app).
- Your conversations are stored locally on your machine, so only you can access them.
